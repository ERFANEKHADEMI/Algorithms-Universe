# A* Search Algorithm

The A* search algorithm, pronounced **"A-stare"** is an informed search 
algorithm that balances the need to explore the search space efficiently 
with the aim of finding the shortest path. It is widely used in pathfinding 
and graph traversal, especially in scenarios where finding the optimal path is essential.

## How Does A Search Work? 🕵️‍♂️

A* search combines the concepts of breadth-first search and a heuristic evaluation function. 
It operates with the following steps:

1. Start at the initial node (usually the start node) and add it to an open list.
2. While the open list is not empty:
    - Choose the node with the lowest estimated cost to reach the target (usually a combination of the actual cost from the start node and a heuristic cost).
    - Expand this node by considering all of its neighbors.
    - Calculate the estimated cost of each neighbor (usually a sum of the cost to reach the neighbor from the current node and a heuristic cost to reach the target from the neighbor).
    - Add the neighbors to the open list and mark the current node as visited.
    - If the target node is reached, the search is complete, and the optimal path can be reconstructed.

> The key to A*'s efficiency and optimality lies in its use of heuristics, which provide informed estimates of the remaining cost to reach the target from a given node.

## Complexity Analysis 📊

#### Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of A* search depends on the implementation and 
the specifics of the heuristic used. In the worst case, it can be 
exponential, but with an admissible and consistent heuristic, it 
becomes very efficient, often outperforming other search algorithms. 
The time complexity is generally expressed as `O(b^d)`, where "b" is the 
branching factor (average number of successors per node) and "d" is the depth 
of the optimal solution.

#### Space Complexity: 
The space complexity depends on the size of the open and closed 
lists and the data structure used for storing them. 
In the worst case, it can be exponential, but this can be mitigated by 
using memory-efficient data structures. The space complexity is typically expressed as `O(b^d)`

## Applications of A* Search Algorithm  🌍

- Pathfinding: Finding the shortest path in games, robotics, and navigation systems.
- Routing and Navigation: Optimal route planning in maps and GPS systems.
- Network Routing: Efficient data routing in computer networks.
- Artificial Intelligence: Solving puzzles, planning, and optimization problems.
- Industrial Automation: Path planning for robots and machinery in manufacturing and logistics.

> Due to its complexity and lengthy code, instead of providing the actual implementation code, I will provide some pseudocode and references where you can check the actual code.

```js filename="pseudocode" 
function AStarSearch(graph, start, target):
    create an open list
    create a closed list
    add the start node to the open list

    while the open list is not empty:
        current = node with the lowest estimated cost in the open list
        remove current from the open list
        add current to the closed list

        if current is the target node:
            return the path from start to target

        for each neighbor of current:
            if neighbor is in the closed list:
                skip to the next neighbor
            if neighbor is not in the open list:
                calculate the estimated cost for neighbor
                add neighbor to the open list

    return no path found
