# Humor Sorts 🎭🤡

Hey there, algorithm enthusiasts! I hope you're all doing great after exploring 
the world of sorting algorithms on this website. You've probably picked up some useful 
insights along the way. Now, let's take a fun and lighthearted detour as we dive into 
the world of sorting algorithms with a sense of humor. We've got a list of these quirky 
methods that range from being just plain silly to strangely interesting, but one thing's 
for sure—they're all pretty darn funny.😄 You might even find some of them oddly fascinating. 
So, without any more delay, let's jump right into this list of unusual ways to sort stuff. 
It's time to embrace the lighter side of coding! 🚀💻

**So, here's the list of algorithms that we'll describe one by one below:**

### Quantum Bogosort🌌

Quantum BogoSort a quantum sorting algorithm which can sort any list in `O(1)`, 
using the [many worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) 
of [quantum mechanics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics)

Here's how it works:
1. Initially, the algorithm quantumly shuffles the given list in a way that 
conceals the order of elements until observation. This process effectively creates `O(n!)` parallel universes, 
though this division has no discernible impact on resources, given that it occurs continuously in [quantum mechanics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics)
2. If the list is not sorted, destroy the universe. (This operation is left as an exercise to the reader.)
3. All remaining universes contain lists which are sorted...


### Sleep Sort😴⏳

Sleep Sort is an unusual sorting method where each number in the input array 
creates a separate "sleeping" thread. The thread that wakes up first represents 
the smallest number, and this continues until the largest number awakens, producing 
a sorted output. However, it has limitations: it can't handle negative numbers, and large 
numbers slow it down. Plus, it may not always sort correctly in certain scenarios. This algorithm 
relies on the operating system's scheduling, and its time complexity is debated but is roughly 
`O(n*log(n) + max(input))`. 

In a nutshell, `Sleep Sort` is a fun and quirky way to sort numbers while 
utilizing the operating system's [multithreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture))
and scheduling capabilities.

### Intelligent Design Sort🧠

**Intelligent Design Sort** is a sorting algorithm based on the theory of [intelligent design.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design)

The algorithm posits that the likelihood of the input list being in its current order by 
random chance is exceedingly small `1/(n!)`, suggesting that it must have been intentionally 
arranged by an intelligent entity. Therefore, it's assumed that the list is already optimally 
sorted in a way beyond our understanding of traditional _ascending order._ Any attempt to change 
this order to fit our human notions of sorting would only make it less sorted.

**Analysis:** This algorithm operates in _constant time O(1)_, sorting the list _in-place_ without requiring any 
additional memory or conventional computer technology.

### Miracle Sort✨🪄

Miracle sort checks to see if the list is sorted, if not, then it waits for 
a bit and after a bit, it'll check to see if the list is sorted again. The only way 
for miracle sort to sort an unsorted array is if by some miracle the bits in the computer 
were to somehow rearrange themselves in a way so that the list is sorted. 

### Bogobogosort🃏

There's a subcategory of bogosort which first bogosorts the first element of the list, 
then bogosorts the first two elements of the list, then the first three until eventually, 
it reaches the end and has to bogosort the entire list. This is bogosorts within bogosorts which 
is absolutely useless since a successful bogosort for a smaller list won't help bogosort the larger 
list. To make it even more inefficient, if the list is ever out of order, then bogobogosort will 
resort again starting from the first element.

### Jingle Sort🔔🎵

### Bozo Sort🤡🃏

Bozosort is named similarly to bogosort and works similarly to bogosort. 
Bozosort is slightly faster than bogosort. Bogosort shuffles the entire list but
bozosort picks two random elements of the list to swap until the list is sorted. 
There's also [wandersort](https://twitter.com/hbmmaster/status/1503187961281748992) 
which is like a more efficient version of bozosort. While 
bozosort will swap the two random elements it picks no matter what, wandersort will 
choose two random elements but only swap them if they need to be swapped.

### PermSort🧮🧩

### Stooge Sort🎭

### Stack Sort🧱

This sort has absolutely nothing to do with stacks. How it works is it scrapes [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) 
for posts tagged "sort" and "javascript". Stack sort can be tried [here](https://gkoberger.github.io/stacksort/)

### Panic Sort😱🌀
