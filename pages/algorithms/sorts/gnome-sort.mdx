## What's Gnome Sort? üí°
Gnome Sort, often humorously referred to as "Stupid Sort," is a simple sorting 
algorithm that works by repeatedly moving an element to its correct position,
much like a gnome who sorts a row of flower pots by looking at them one by one. 
It is a basic, but not very efficient, sorting algorithm. 
Gnome Sort can be considered a variation of Insertion Sort, where an element is 
moved to its proper place by comparing it with the previous element.

## Time Complexity: ‚è±Ô∏è 
| Best Case  | Average Case  | Worst Case |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------- |
|   `O(n)`   |   `O(n^2)`    |  `O(n^2)`  |

## Space Complexity: ‚öôÔ∏è 
Gnome Sort typically has a space complexity of `O(1)` since 
it sorts the array in-place, without requiring additional memory for temporary data structures.


### Strengths and Weaknesses of Gnome Sort ü§ì
#### Strengths: ‚ö™Ô∏è

- Simplicity: Gnome Sort is straightforward to understand and implement. 
It can serve as a simple educational example of a sorting algorithm.

#### Weaknesses: üî¥
- Inefficiency: Gnome Sort is highly inefficient, especially for larger datasets. 
It performs poorly compared to more efficient sorting algorithms.

- Lack of Adaptiveness: It doesn't adapt well to partially sorted data, and its performance 
is not guaranteed to improve in such cases.


Here's a simple implementation of Gnome Sort in JavaScript:
## Code üñã
```js filename="gnome-sort.js" copy
const gnomeSort = (arr) => {
  let index = 0;
  while (index < arr.length) {
    if (index === 0 || arr[index] >= arr[index - 1]) {
      index++;
    } else {
      [arr[index], arr[index - 1]] = [arr[index - 1], arr[index]];
      index--;
    }
  }
  return arr;
}

const unsortedArray = [71, 75, 17, 91, 7, 11, 95, 5, 9, 6];
const sortedArray = gnomeSort(unsortedArray);
console.log(sortedArray); // [5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 17, 71, 75, 91, 95] 
```

## Conclusion üóØÔ∏è
Gnome Sort, sometimes humorously called "Stupid Sort," is a simple sorting algorithm that 
is not recommended for practical use due to its inefficiency, especially for larger datasets. 
It serves more as a simple educational example or a historical curiosity than a sorting algorithm 
of choice in real-world applications. There are much more efficient sorting algorithms available.
