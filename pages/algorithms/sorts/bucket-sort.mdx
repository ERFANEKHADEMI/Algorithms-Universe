# Bucket sort ü™£ 

## What's Bucket Sort? üí°
Bucket Sort is a sorting algorithm that divides the input array 
into a set of buckets and then individually sorts each bucket, 
typically using another sorting algorithm like(for example) insertion sort. 
After sorting all the buckets, the elements are concatenated to 
produce the fully sorted array. Bucket Sort is particularly effective 
when the input data is uniformly distributed across a range. 
It was first introduced by George P√≥lya in 1945.

## Time Complexity: ‚è±Ô∏è 
Radix Sort has a time complexity of `O(nk)`, where "n" is the number of 
elements in the input array, and "k" is the number of digits or significant 
positions in the largest element. When `k` is constant (limited), 

| Best Case  | Average Case  | Worst Case |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------- |
|   `O(n + k)`   |   `O(n + k)`    |  `O(n^2)`  |

## Space Complexity: ‚öôÔ∏è 
Bucket Sort typically has a space complexity of `O(n)`, where "n" is the number of elements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses of Bucket Sort ü§ì
#### Strengths: ‚ö™Ô∏è

- Efficient for Uniform Data: Bucket Sort performs exceptionally 
well when the data is evenly distributed across a range, achieving linear time complexity.

- Easily Parallelizable: The sorting of individual buckets can be 
parallelized, making it efficient on multi-core processors.



#### Weaknesses: üî¥
- Not Suitable for All Data: It may not perform well when the 
data is not uniformly distributed or when the range of values is too wide.

- Bucket Overhead: Managing and sorting the buckets adds some 
overhead, making it less efficient for small datasets. lengths or floating-point numbers with extreme precision.


## Code üñã
```js filename="bucket-sort.js" copy
const bucketSort = (arr) => {
  const n = arr.length;

  if (n <= 1) return arr;

  // Determine the range of values in the array
  const minValue = Math.min(...arr);
  const maxValue = Math.max(...arr);
  const bucketSize = Math.floor((maxValue - minValue) / n) + 1;

  // Create an array of empty buckets
  const buckets = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);

  // Distribute elements into buckets
  arr.forEach((num) => {
    const bucketIndex = Math.floor((num - minValue) / bucketSize);
    buckets[bucketIndex].push(num);
  });

  // Sort individual buckets (you can use any sorting algorithm here)
  buckets.forEach((bucket) => bucket.sort((a, b) => a - b));

  // Concatenate the sorted buckets to produce the final sorted array
  const sortedArray = [].concat(...buckets);

  return sortedArray;
}

// Example usage:
const unsortedArray = [1, 3, 45, 9, 23, 34, 27];
const sortedArray = bucketSort(unsortedArray);
console.log(sortedArray); // [1, 3, 9, 23, 27, 34, 45]
```

## Conclusion üóØÔ∏è
Bucket Sort is an effective sorting algorithm when dealing with 
data that is uniformly distributed across a range. It can achieve 
linear time complexity in such cases and is easily parallelizable, 
making it suitable for certain parallel processing environments. 
However, its performance may degrade when the data distribution is uneven, 
and it can have some overhead due to bucket management. 
Bucket Sort is a valuable sorting technique for specific scenarios where 
the input data characteristics match its strengths.
