# Cocktail Shaker Sort

## What's Cocktail Shaker Sort? üí°

Cocktail Shaker Sort, also known as Bidirectional Bubble Sort, 
Shaker Sort, or simply Cocktail Sort, is a variation of the Bubble Sort algorithm. 
It's called "Cocktail Shaker" because it sorts elements much like the way you'd shake a 
cocktail by moving items in both directions. It works by repeatedly stepping through the list, 
comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. 
It continues this process until no more swaps are needed. Cocktail Shaker Sort is 
not commonly used in practice due to its inefficiency for larger datasets.

## Time Complexity: ‚è±Ô∏è 
| Best Case  | Average Case  | Worst Case |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------- |
|   `O(n)`   |   `O(n ^ 2)`    |  `O(n ^ 2)`  |

## Space Complexity: ‚öôÔ∏è 
Cocktail Shaker Sort typically has a space complexity of `O(1)` since 
it sorts the array in-place, without requiring additional memory for temporary data structures.



### Strengths and Weaknesses of Cocktail Shaker Sort ü§ì
#### Strengths: ‚ö™Ô∏è

- In-Place Sorting: Cocktail Shaker Sort sorts the array in-place, saving memory.

- Stable Sorting: It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements.

#### Weaknesses: üî¥
- Inefficiency: Cocktail Shaker Sort is highly inefficient, especially for 
large datasets. There are much more efficient sorting algorithms available, like QuickSort or Merge Sort.

- Lack of Adaptiveness: It doesn't adapt well to partially sorted data, 
and its performance is not guaranteed to improve in such cases.

## Cocktail Shaker Sort vs Bubble Sort ‚ûø
This algorithm extends Bubble Sort by operating in two directions. 
Instead of going from the start to finish, and repeating that, it goes 
from start to finish, and then from finish to start again, in a single 
full iteration. Effectively, it accomplishes double the work of Bubble Sort 
in a single full iteration, though in practice it doesn't typically perform two times faster.

This is because it has a similar comparison-count. It compares more elements 
per iteration than regular Bubble Sort and it does double the swaps per iteration. 
The reason it's faster is because the range of possible swaps per iteration gets 
smaller and smaller, giving it a slightly better performance.

## Code üñã
```js filename="cocktailShakerSort.js" copy
const cocktailShakerSort = (arr) => {
  let swapped;
  do {
    swapped = false;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
      if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
        [arr[i], arr[i + 1]] = [arr[i + 1], arr[i]];
        swapped = true;
      }
    }
    if (!swapped) break;
    swapped = false;
    for (let j = arr.length - 2; j >= 0; j--) {
      if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
        [arr[j], arr[j + 1]] = [arr[j + 1], arr[j]];
        swapped = true;
      }
    }
  } while (swapped);
  return arr;
}

// Example usage:
const unsortedArray = [2, 100, 29, 25, 61, 82, 58, 62, 23, 57, 5, 25];
const sortedArray = cocktailShakerSort(unsortedArray);
console.log(sortedArray); // [2, 5, 23, 25, 25, 29, 57, 58, 61, 62, 82, 100]
```

## Conclusion üóØÔ∏è
Cocktail Shaker Sort, although conceptually simple, is generally not a 
recommended sorting algorithm due to its inefficiency, especially for 
larger datasets. There are far more efficient sorting algorithms 
available that perform significantly better. It's often used for 
educational purposes or as a demonstration of the Bubble Sort concept.
