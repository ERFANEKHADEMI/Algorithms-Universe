# Radix sort üí† 

## What's Radix Sort? üí°
Radix Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that works by distributing 
elements into buckets based on their individual digits or other significant 
positions. It sorts the elements by processing digits from the least significant 
to the most significant (or vice versa) until the entire array is sorted. 
Radix Sort is known for its linear time complexity when the number of digits or 
significant positions is limited. It was first introduced by Herman Hollerith in 
the late 19th century for sorting punched cards.

## Time Complexity: ‚è±Ô∏è 
Radix Sort has a time complexity of `O(nk)`, where "n" is the number of 
elements in the input array, and "k" is the number of digits or significant 
positions in the largest element. When `k` is constant (limited), 

| Best Case  | Average Case  | Worst Case |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------- |
|   `O(nk)`   |   `O(nk)`    |  `O(nk)`  |

## Space Complexity: ‚öôÔ∏è 
Radix Sort typically has a space complexity of `O(n + k)` 
since it requires additional memory for temporary storage during the sorting process.


### Strengths and Weaknesses of Radix Sort ü§ì
#### Strengths: ‚ö™Ô∏è

- Stable Sorting: Radix Sort is inherently stable, meaning it 
preserves the relative order of equal elements.



#### Weaknesses: üî¥
- Memory Usage: Radix Sort can be memory-intensive, especially when 
sorting large datasets or elements with a large number of significant positions.

- Limited Applicability: It's not suitable for sorting elements with 
complex structures, such as strings with varying lengths or floating-point numbers with extreme precision.

Here's a simple implementation of Radix Sort in JavaScript:
## Code üñã
```js filename="radix-sort.js" copy
const getMax = (arr) => {
  let max = arr[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] > max) {
      max = arr[i];
    }
  }
  return max;
}

const countingSort = (arr, exp) => {
  const n = arr.length;
  const output = Array(n).fill(0);
  const count = Array(10).fill(0);

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    count[Math.floor(arr[i] / exp) % 10]++;
  }

  for (let i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    count[i] += count[i - 1];
  }

  for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    output[count[Math.floor(arr[i] / exp) % 10] - 1] = arr[i];
    count[Math.floor(arr[i] / exp) % 10]--;
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    arr[i] = output[i];
  }
}

const radixSort = (arr) => {
  const max = getMax(arr);

  for (let exp = 1; Math.floor(max / exp) > 0; exp *= 10) {
    countingSort(arr, exp);
  }

  return arr;
}

// Example usage:
const unsortedArray = [31, 27, 28, 42, 13, 8];
const sortedArray = radixSort(unsortedArray);
console.log(sortedArray); // [8, 13, 27, 28, 31, 42]
```

## Conclusion üóØÔ∏è
Radix Sort is a specialized sorting algorithm that performs well when the number 
of digits or significant positions is limited. Its linear time complexity in such 
cases makes it a valuable tool for sorting integers and other data types where the 
key is composed of a fixed number of digits or positions. However, it may not be the 
best choice for more complex data structures or situations with limited memory.
