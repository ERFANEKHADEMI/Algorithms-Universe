# Counting sort üíπ 

## What's Counting Sort? üí°
Counting Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that 
works by counting the number of elements with distinct key values 
(i.e., counting the occurrences of each element) and using this information to place each element 
in its sorted position. Counting Sort is highly efficient when the 
range of input values is small and known in advance. It was invented by Harold H. Seward in 1954.

## Time Complexity: ‚è±Ô∏è 
Counting Sort has a time complexity of `O(n + k)`, where "n" is the number of 
elements in the input array, and "k" is the range of distinct input values. 
It is particularly efficient when "k" is relatively small.

| Best Case  | Average Case  | Worst Case |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------- |
|   `O(n + k)`   |   `O(n + k)`    |  `O(n + k)`  |

## Space Complexity: ‚öôÔ∏è 
Counting Sort typically has a space complexity of `O(k)`, 
which depends on the range of distinct values in the input.


### Strengths and Weaknesses of Counting Sort ü§ì
#### Strengths: ‚ö™Ô∏è

- Linear Time Complexity: Counting Sort is efficient and can sort 
data in linear time when the range of values is small.

- Stable Sorting: It preserves the relative order of equal elements, 
making it a stable sorting algorithm.



#### Weaknesses: üî¥
- Limited Applicability: Counting Sort is not suitable for 
sorting data with a wide range of values or when the range is not known in advance.

- Additional Memory: It can be memory-intensive when the range of values 
is significantly larger than the number of elements in the array.

## Code üñã
```js filename="counting-sort.js" copy
const countingSort = (arr) => {
  const n = arr.length;

  // Find the maximum value in the input array
  const max = Math.max(...arr);

  // Create a counting array and initialize it with zeros
  const count = Array(max + 1).fill(0);

  // Count the occurrences of each element
  arr.forEach((num) => count[num]++);

  // Reconstruct the sorted array from the counting array
  const sortedArray = [];
  for (let i = 0; i <= max; i++) {
    while (count[i] > 0) {
      sortedArray.push(i);
      count[i]--;
    }
  }

  return sortedArray;
}

const unsortedArray = [11, 2, 2, 8, 4, 3, 1];
const sortedArray = countingSort(unsortedArray);
console.log(sortedArray); // [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 8, 11]
```

## Conclusion üóØÔ∏è
Counting Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm when dealing 
with data that has a small range of values, especially when the range is
known in advance. It achieves linear time complexity and preserves the 
relative order of equal elements, making it a stable sorting algorithm. 
However, it may not be suitable for sorting data with a wide range of values, 
as it can become memory-intensive in such cases. Counting Sort is a valuable 
tool for specific scenarios where its strengths align with the characteristics of the input data.
