# Merge sort 🛠️

## What's Merge Sort? 💡
Merge Sort is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm that falls 
under the category of "divide and conquer" algorithms. It was developed 
by John von Neumann in 1945. Merge Sort works by breaking down an unsorted 
list into smaller sub-lists, sorting those sub-lists, and then merging them 
back together to produce a fully sorted list. It's a stable sorting algorithm, 
which means it maintains the relative order of equal elements.

## Time Complexity: ⏱️ 
The time complexity of Selection Sort is quadratic, which means it's not efficient for large datasets. 
It performs roughly n^2 comparisons and n swaps, regardless of the initial order of the elements

| Best Case  | Average Case  | Worst Case |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------- |
|   `O(n^2)`   |   `O(n^2)`    |  `O(n^2)`  |

## Space Complexity: ⚙️ 
The space complexity of Selection Sort is `O(1)`, meaning it doesn't require additional 
memory allocation proportional to the input size. It sorts the array [in place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm), making 
it memory-efficient.


## Strengths and Weaknesses of Selection Sort 🤓
#### Strengths: ⚪️

- Simple to understand and implement.
- Memory-efficient (in-place sorting).
- Stable sorting preserves the order of equal elements.
- Suitable for small lists with low overhead.

#### Weaknesses: 🔴

- Highly inefficient for large datasets (quadratic time complexity).
- Lacks adaptivity to partially sorted input.
- Limited potential for parallel processing.

## Code 🖋
```js filename="selection-sort.js" copy
const selectionSort = (arr) => {
    const len = arr.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < len - 1; i++) {
        let minIndex = i;
        for (let j = i + 1; j < len; j++) {
            if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
                minIndex = j;
            }
        }
        if (minIndex !== i) {
            // Swap arr[i] and arr[minIndex]
            [arr[i], arr[minIndex]] = [arr[minIndex], arr[i]];
        }
    }
}

const numbers = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11];
selectionSort(numbers);
console.log(numbers); // Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
```



## Conclusion 🗯️
Selection Sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm with 
a predictable time and space complexity. While it's not efficient 
for large datasets, it can be useful for educational purposes and for 
sorting small lists or arrays where simplicity and minimal memory usage
are more important than sorting speed. However, in most practical scenarios,
other sorting algorithms like [Quick Sort](quick-sort) or [Merge Sort](merge-sort) are preferred for
their better performance characteristics.
