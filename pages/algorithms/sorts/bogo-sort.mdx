# Bogosort 🥴

## What's Bogosort? 💡
BogoSort or "Monkey Sort" is an impractical and humorous sorting algorithm.
It's often humorously referred to as a "stupid sort" because it relies on pure luck to sort the elements.
BogoSort takes a novel approach to sorting by randomly permuting the elements in an array until it stumbles 
upon a permutation where the array is sorted. It relies solely on random chance and can take an indefinite 
amount of time to complete, making it one of the most inefficient sorting algorithms.

## Time Complexity: ⏱️ 
| Best Case  | Average Case  | Worst Case |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------- |
|   `O(n)`   |   `O(n * n!)`    |  `O(∞)`  |

## Space Complexity: ⚙️ 
The space complexity is `O(1)` because it doesn't require additional memory.

### Strengths and Weaknesses of Bogosort 🥴
#### Strengths: ⚪️

- Simplicity: BogoSort is incredibly simple to understand and implement.

#### Weaknesses: 🔴
- Extreme Inefficiency: BogoSort is an incredibly inefficient and impractical 
sorting algorithm. It has no guaranteed time frame for sorting, and the chances 
of sorting even small datasets are astronomically low.

- No Practical Use: It's used primarily for humor and is not suitable for any real-world applications.

## Code 🖋
```js filename="bogosort.js" copy
function isSorted(arr) {
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] < arr[i - 1]) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

function bogosort(arr) {
  while (!isSorted(arr)) {
    arr = shuffle(arr);
  }
  return arr;
}

function shuffle(arr) {
  for (let i = arr.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
    [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]];
  }
  return arr;
}

const unsortedArray = [123, 3, 1, 7, 0, 4, 2, 9, 6, 5, 22, 0, 123, 1, 0];
const sortedArray = bogosort(unsortedArray); // still sorting... 😂
console.log(sortedArray); 
```

## Conclusion 🗯️
Bogosort is a joke sorting algorithm that relies on sheer luck to sort an array. 
While it's simple to understand, its extreme inefficiency and unpredictability make 
it entirely unsuitable for any practical use. It's typically used as a humorous example 
of what not to do when designing sorting algorithms and serves as a reminder of the importance 
of efficiency in algorithm design.
