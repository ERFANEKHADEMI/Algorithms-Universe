# Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm üí°

The KMP Algorithm is a sophisticated string matching algorithm that minimizes 
unnecessary character comparisons by utilizing information from previous comparisons. 
It achieves this through the clever use of a _"failure function"_ or _"prefix function,"_ 
which denotes the length of the longest proper prefix that is also a proper suffix of a string.

## How Does KMP Algorithm Work? üëÄ

KMP Algorithm operates with the following steps:

1. Preprocessing (Building the Failure Function(also called _"prefix function"_ or _"LPS array"_)): 
    - Analyze the pattern to create a _"failure function"_ table, which stores information about the lengths of proper prefixes that are also proper suffixes.

2. Searching:
    - Move through the text and pattern simultaneously.
    - If a mismatch occurs at position j in the pattern, use the failure function to determine the next position to compare in the pattern.

Here's a simplified pseudocode representation of the KMP Algorithm:

```js 
function KMPSearch(text, pattern):
    n = length of text
    m = length of pattern

    // Build the failure function
    failureFunction = buildFailureFunction(pattern)

    // Searching
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < n:
        if pattern[j] equals text[i]:
            if j equals m - 1:
                // Pattern found starting at index i - j in the text
                return i - j
            i++
            j++
        else if j > 0:
            j = failureFunction[j - 1]
        else:
            i++

    // Pattern not found in the text
    return -1
```

## Complexity Analysis for KMP Algorithm üìä

### Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of the KMP Algorithm is `O(n + m)`, where "n" 
is the length of the text and "m" is the length of the pattern. The preprocessing step takes 
`O(m)` time, and the searching step takes `O(n)` time.


### Space Complexity: 
The space complexity is `O(m)`, where "m" is the length of the pattern. 
This space is required to store the failure function table.

### Optimality: 
KMP Algorithm is optimal for string matching, providing a 
linear time complexity by efficiently avoiding unnecessary character comparisons.

## Applications of KMP Algorithm ü™ê

- Text Editors: Used for searching patterns in text documents.
- Bioinformatics: Applied in DNA sequence matching.
- Compilers: Utilized for pattern matching in lexical analysis.
- Data Mining: Employed for efficient substring matching in large datasets.

## JS Implementation

```js filename="KMPSearch.js" copy
function computeLPS(pattern, m, lps) {
    let maxPrefix = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        
        while (maxPrefix > 0 && pattern[i] !== pattern[maxPrefix]) {
            maxPrefix = lps[maxPrefix - 1];
        }

        if (pattern[i] === pattern[maxPrefix]) {
            maxPrefix++;
        }

        lps[i] = maxPrefix;
    }
}

function KMPSearch(text, pattern) {
    const n = text.length;
    const m = pattern.length;
    const LPS = Array(m).fill(0);
    
    computeLPS(pattern, m, LPS);
    
    let i = 0;
    let j = 0;

    while (i < n) {
        if (pattern[j] === text[i]) {
            if (j === m - 1) {
                return i - j; // Pattern found starting at index i - j in the text
            }
            i++;
            j++;
        } else if (j > 0) {
            j = LPS[j - 1];
        } else {
            i++;
        }
    }

    return -1; // Pattern not found in the text
}

// Example usage
const text = "ABABDABACDABABCABAB";
const pattern = "ABABCABAB";

const result = KMPSearch(text, pattern);

if (result !== -1) {
    console.log(`Pattern found at index ${result} in the text.`);
} else {
    console.log("Pattern not found in the text.");
}

// Result: Pattern found at index 10 in the text.
```
