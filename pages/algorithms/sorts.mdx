# Sorting Algorithms üíé

The world of computer science is enriched by the presence of sorting algorithms, 
and "AlgoUniverse" aims to empower developers, students, and enthusiasts to 
harness their potential. Dive into this collection, explore the intricacies of sorting, 
and discover how these algorithms are the unsung heroes that make the digital world spin smoothly.

In real life, these algorithms are everywhere:

- üîç Search Engines: When you search for stuff online, sorting algorithms help you find what you need quickly.

- üõçÔ∏è Online Shopping: Sorting makes your online shopping a breeze, showing you the best deals first.

- üìû Contact Lists: Your phone uses sorting to help you find contacts faster.

- üéµ Music and Video Playlists: Sorting algorithms create playlists based on your favorite songs or videos.

- üìö Library Catalogs: When you look for a book at the library, sorting algorithms make it easy.

> These were just a few examples of how sorting algorithms are used in the real world, but there are many more ways they are utilized

Sorting algorithms might sound complex, but we've simplified them by providing some information about each 
algorithm, followed by its time and space complexity. We also offer JavaScript (JS) code and visualizing 
GIFs to show how these algorithms work, making it easy for you to learn and use them effectively.
